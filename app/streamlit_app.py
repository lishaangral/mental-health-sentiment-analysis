**Why are we doing this?**

This tool helps you understand and reflect on your current emotional state using a fine-tuned AI model trained on real mental health conversations.

Just type out your thoughts or feelings in the box below and the model will try to detect the underlying emotion. You'll also receive a small suggestion tailored to that emotion.
